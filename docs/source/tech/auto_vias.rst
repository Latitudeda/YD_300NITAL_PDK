auto_vias.py
====================

Define the vias between different metal line type.

In **YD 300NITAL PDK**, there is only one metal layer,  so vias between different metal layers are not configured. This file is used for auto-routing related to the metal layer.

Users are allowed to change slope of the linear taper by their own specific requirements. Please see ``technology > auto_vias.py`` to modifiy the default slope.
